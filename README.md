# FallOrFool
## Goal
#### My goal was to get to know the basics of Unity 2D(and of course to have fun ;) ) and create a playable(completable) game.
#### I was messing around with splashscreens, scenes, camera movements, 2D rigidbodies and interactions.

### Unity version: 2020.1.8f1
### Executable game repo: https://github.com/RayToth/FallGame
